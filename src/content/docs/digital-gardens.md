# Digital Garden Concepts

Digital gardens are a new way of sharing knowledge online—less like polished articles and more like tended thoughts that grow over time. Here's how to cultivate your own.

## What Makes a Digital Garden Different

Unlike traditional blogs, digital gardens prioritize **connection over chronology** and **growth over perfection**.

### Traditional Blog vs Digital Garden

| Blog | Digital Garden |
|------|----------------|
| Chronological posts | Network of connected ideas |
| Published when "complete" | Continuously evolving |
| Linear reading | Non-linear exploration |
| Polished content | Work-in-progress acceptable |

### Example: Blog Post
```markdown
# "Complete Guide to React Hooks" 
Published: Jan 15, 2024

[2,000 polished words...]

Tags: React, JavaScript
```

### Example: Garden Note
```markdown
# React Hooks 🌿

**Status**: Growing
**Connected to**: [[useState]], [[useEffect]], [[Custom Hooks]]
**Last updated**: Jan 20, 2024

Quick thoughts on hooks...

## Questions I'm exploring:
- How do hooks compare to class components?
- Best practices for custom hooks?

**See also**: [[React Patterns]], [[State Management]]
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Learning in Public
Share your thinking process, not just conclusions:
- Half-formed ideas
- Questions without answers  
- Work in progress
- Failed experiments

### 2. Interconnected Knowledge
Every note can link to others, creating a web of ideas:

```markdown
<!-- Wiki-style linking -->
Understanding [[JavaScript Closures]] helps with [[React Hook Dependencies]].

When building [[React Components]], consider [[State Management]] patterns.

<!-- Bidirectional connections -->
This note links to [[Performance Optimization]]
← Which links back to this note
```

### 3. Gradual Growth
Notes evolve through different stages:

- 🌱 **Seedling**: New idea, basic thoughts
- 🌿 **Growing**: Developing content, regular updates  
- 🌳 **Mature**: Well-developed, stable ideas
- 🍎 **Evergreen**: Timeless content, frequently referenced

## Setting Up Your Garden Structure

### File Organization

```
/content
  /notes
    - javascript-fundamentals.md
    - react-patterns.md
    - web-performance.md
  /maps
    - frontend-development.md  # Maps of Content (MOCs)
    - learning-resources.md
  /journal
    - 2024-01-15-daily-notes.md
    - project-reflections.md
```

### Note Templates

Create consistent structure with templates:

```markdown
---
title: "{{title}}"
status: seedling
tags: []
created: {{date}}
updated: {{date}}
---

# {{title}}

## Summary
Brief description in one sentence.

## Key Points
- Main idea 1
- Main idea 2

## Questions
- What don't I understand yet?
- What needs more research?

## Connected Notes
- [[Related Note 1]]
- [[Related Note 2]]

## References
- [Source 1](url)
```

## Linking Strategies

### 1. Concept Links
```markdown
[[React Hooks]] changed how we write components.
```

### 2. Contextual Links  
```markdown
When building [[React Components|complex components]], 
consider [[State Management|how to handle state]].
```

### 3. Question Links
```markdown
How do [[JavaScript Closures]] relate to [[React Hooks]]?
```

### 4. Reference Links
```markdown
According to [[Clean Code by Robert Martin]], functions should be small.
```

## Building Your Garden

### Phase 1: Plant Seeds (Week 1)
1. Create 10-15 notes from existing knowledge
2. Set up basic linking between notes
3. Establish your note-taking workflow

### Phase 2: Tend & Connect (Month 1)
1. Add new notes regularly
2. Link new content to existing notes
3. Identify emerging themes and clusters

### Phase 3: Cultivate (Month 2-3)  
1. Create Maps of Content (MOCs) for major topics
2. Strengthen weak connections
3. Develop your unique voice and style

### Phase 4: Share & Grow (Month 3+)
1. Make your garden public
2. Engage with other digital gardeners
3. Collaborate and cross-pollinate ideas

## Technical Implementation

### Wiki-style Links with Astro

```javascript path=null start=null
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [
      ['remark-wiki-link', {
        pageResolver: (name) => [name.replace(/ /g, '-').toLowerCase()],
        hrefTemplate: (permalink) => `/notes/${permalink}`
      }]
    ]
  }
});
```

### Backlinks Component

```astro path=null start=null
---
// components/Backlinks.astro
const { currentSlug } = Astro.props;
const allNotes = await Astro.glob('../content/notes/*.md');

const backlinks = allNotes.filter(note => {
  const content = note.rawContent();
  return content.includes(`[[${currentSlug}]]`) && note.url !== Astro.url.pathname;
});
---

{backlinks.length > 0 && (
  <aside class="backlinks">
    <h3>Referenced by:</h3>
    <ul>
      {backlinks.map(note => (
        <li>
          <a href={note.url}>{note.frontmatter.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </aside>
)}
```

### Simple Graph Visualization

```javascript path=null start=null
// Generate simple connection graph
function createNoteGraph(notes) {
  const nodes = notes.map(note => ({
    id: note.slug,
    title: note.frontmatter.title,
    connections: extractLinks(note.content)
  }));

  const edges = [];
  nodes.forEach(node => {
    node.connections.forEach(connection => {
      if (nodes.find(n => n.id === connection)) {
        edges.push({ source: node.id, target: connection });
      }
    });
  });

  return { nodes, edges };
}

function extractLinks(content) {
  const linkPattern = /\[\[([^\]]+)\]\]/g;
  const links = [];
  let match;
  
  while ((match = linkPattern.exec(content)) !== null) {
    links.push(match[1].toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-'));
  }
  
  return [...new Set(links)]; // Remove duplicates
}
```

## Maintenance Practices

### Daily (5 minutes)
- Capture new ideas quickly
- Link new notes to existing ones
- Update existing notes with new insights

### Weekly (30 minutes)  
- Review and strengthen connections
- Identify orphaned notes (no links)
- Plan new areas to explore

### Monthly (1 hour)
- Create or update Maps of Content
- Archive outdated information  
- Assess overall garden health

## Getting Started Tips

1. **Start small**: Begin with topics you're passionate about
2. **Don't aim for perfection**: Rough notes are better than no notes
3. **Link early and often**: Create connections as you write
4. **Be consistent**: Regular tending is better than occasional marathons
5. **Make it public**: Sharing encourages continued growth
